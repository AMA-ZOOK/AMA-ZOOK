i allow c+h espescially from my close friends but idm if a random person wants to i coul jusy be a bit awkward 

i dont allow inspo for my skins, srry

im usually at osc or forsaken area,, but sometimes i could js be at random places by myself or with a friend /w friends

pls dont make grape jokes around me.. its js gross and makes me uncomfortable in the first place

idm if u want to int with me just know i could be awkward sometimes and i get scared too sometimes but it depends how comf i am with u

fandoms im in are ; rblx myth, 4saken, osc, dw

((4 dw i dont play it a lot anymore tho and im slightly scared of interacting with the fandom))

im mostly with my friends but its rare-ish if im by myself ?

i am hypersensitive, so be careful pls! and i wont always be able to tell if i do something wrong,,
